1.Problem Statement: Self-Healing Web Application
===============================
Background:
Imagine a website that watches users struggle and fixes itself automatically. No waiting for developers — the app learns from problems and resolves them using
intelligent automation and GenAI.
Challenge:
Build a web application that:
1. Tracks user struggles (e.g., clicks, errors, slow pages)
2. Classifies problems using simple rules
3. Automatically fixes itself using GenAI + file operations
4. Validates changes before applying them
5. Learns from history to avoid repeating mistakes
Part 1: User Behavior Tracking
Capture signals like:
- User frustrations: rage clicks, dead clicks, quick back button, repeated form submissions
- Technical events: JS errors, slow API responses, slow page loads
- User journey data: page sequence, scroll depth, time spent
Deliverable: A simple dashboard showing real-time events.
Part 2: Problem Classification
Use simple rules to classify issues:
UI Issues: confusing buttons, unclear clickable areas
Performance: slow page loads, slow API, memory issues
Functionality Bugs: form validation errors, JS errors, broken endpoints
Optional: Use basic clustering (K-Means) for anomaly detection.
Part 3: Auto-Code Modification
Automatically fix issues in the code:
Steps:
1. Identify the problematic code (based on user data)
2. Generate fix using GenAI (e.g., GPT-4)
3. Replace the problematic code in the source file
4. Run tests and validate before deploying
5. Rollback if tests fail
Safety rules:
- Backup files before modification
- Limit changes per file
- Don’t modify critical code (auth/payment)
Part 4: Web Application Demo
Create a Task Management App with intentional issues:
- Slow-loading task list
- Confusing buttons
- Form validation problems
- Slow API
- Missing error handling
Dashboard should display:
- Real-time problems
- Detected problem categories
- Fix status (success/failure)
- History of changes
Stack Suggestions:
Frontend: React or Vue.js
Backend: Python FastAPI or Node.js Express
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Cache: Redis
GenAI: OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude
Deliverables:
1. Live Demo: Task app + self-healing system + dashboard
2. Code Repository: Source code + instructions
3. Technical Document: Architecture + approach + results
4. Demo Video: Show problems and automatic fixes
Evaluation Criteria:
- Automation quality: detecting and fixing problems
- System intelligence: accuracy of classification and fix success rate
- Full-stack implementation: frontend tracking, backend API, dashboard
- Innovation & UX: usability, creativity

AI-POWERED NEWS INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM
===============================
PROBLEM:
Build an ML system to:
✓ Detect fake/misleading news
✓ Analyze sentiment & emotions
✓ Extract & verify factual claims
✓ Generate trustworthy summaries with citations
Goal: Automate news credibility assessment.
===============================
PIPELINE:
News Aggregation → Fake News Detection → Sentiment Analysis →
Fact-Checking → Summarization → Trust Score Assignment
===============================
PART 1: FAKE NEWS DETECTION (30 pts)
Objective: Classify news as Real/Fake
Features: text length, punctuation, ALL CAPS ratio, sentiment, entities
Hint: Look for patterns common in sensational content
Models: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression / Random Forest (baseline), BERT/DistilBERT (advanced)
Datasets: LIAR, Fake News Detection
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision/Recall/F1, False Negative Rate
Output:
{
"label": "Real" / "Fake",
"confidence": 0.91,
"source_credibility": 82
}
===============================
PART 2: SENTIMENT & EMOTION ANALYSIS (25 pts)
Objective: Multi-label emotion + entity-level sentiment
Emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Trust
Hint: Consider words around key entities and emotional cues
Models: Word embeddings + BiLSTM/CNN, optional DistilBERT
Datasets: GoEmotions, Sentiment140
Metrics: Macro/Micro F1, Hamming Loss
Output:
{
"overall_sentiment": "Negative (62%)",
"emotions": {"concern":0.45,"skepticism":0.28},
"entities":[{"name":"Jerome Powell","sentiment":"negative"}]
}
===============================
PART 3: FACT-CHECKING (30 pts)
Steps:
1. Claim Extraction: binary classifier (numbers, dates, entities)
Hint: Statements with verifiable numbers often matter most
2. Evidence Retrieval: TF-IDF or embedding similarity
Hint: Similar text in trusted sources usually confirms claims
3. Verification: NLI (SUPPORTED / REFUTED / NOT_ENOUGH_INFO)
Hint: Check if evidence agrees, contradicts, or is inconclusive
Datasets: FEVER, LIAR, COVID-19 Fake News
Metrics: Claim F1, Verification accuracy, Evidence recall
Output:
{
"claims":[
{"text":"GDP grew 5.2%","verification":"SUPPORTED","confidence":0.87},
{"text":"All economists agree","verification":"REFUTED","confidence":0.92}
]
}
===============================
PART 4: CONTENT GENERATION (15 pts)
Summary: Extractive/Abstractive (TextRank, BART/T5)
Hint: Include only verified facts and highlight uncertain ones
Citations & Trust: /⚠/
Trust Score: combine fake news + fact-check + source credibility
Output Example:
[Trust Score: 85/100]
Summary: "Fed raised rates 0.75%  [Source: Fed.gov]. Claims of unanimous support ."
===============================
IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
Week 1-2: Data prep & baseline models

ADAPTIVE RANSOMWARE DETECTION SYSTEM
ML & Security Operations Challenge
===============================
CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
Build an AI-powered system that detects ransomware attacks in a network.
Focus on three signals: malicious URLs, malware files, and unusual network activity.
Combine these signals to detect full ransomware attack chains.
RANSOMWARE KILL CHAIN
Stage 1: Initial Access → Malicious URL clicked, malware downloaded
Stage 2: Persistence & Lateral Movement → Malware installs backdoor, scans network, attempts logins
Stage 3: Execution → Ransomware encrypts files across the network
ML TASKS (100 POINTS TOTAL)
PART A: MALICIOUS URL DETECTION (30 points)
Task: Detect phishing/malicious URLs
Requirements:
✓ Classifier to detect malicious vs benign URLs
✓ Hint: Use features like URL length, digit/special char count, presence of keywords; models like Random Forest or Logistic Regression work well
✓ Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall
Dataset: [Malicious URLs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset)
PART B: MALWARE FILE CLASSIFICATION (40 points)
Task: Detect ransomware files
Requirements:
✓ Use static file features (PE header info, imports/exports, file size, entropy)
✓ Hint: Train a classifier using Random Forest, XGBoost, or a small neural network; handle class imbalance using weights or oversampling
✓ Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix
Dataset: [EMBER 2018 Malware Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivekanandabharupati/ember2018)
PART C: NETWORK ANOMALY DETECTION (20 points)
Task: Identify lateral movement or suspicious logins
Requirements:
✓ Highlight unusual connections or repeated failed login attempts
✓ Hint: Use flow features (source IP, destination port, connection count); anomaly detection like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM can flag deviations
✓ Evaluate using precision/recall
Dataset: [CICIDS 2017 Network Flow Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bertvankeulen/cicids-2017)
PART D: ATTACK SEQUENCE CORRELATION (10 points)
Task: Combine alerts from Parts A, B, C to detect ransomware attacks
Requirements:
✓ Predict if a ransomware attack is ongoing based on alert sequence
✓ Hint: Simple rule-based correlation works; for more advanced, encode alert sequence and train a small LSTM/GRU to predict multi-stage attacks
Example:
Input: [Malicious URL detected, malware execution, repeated SSH failures]
Output: Ransomware attack detected
